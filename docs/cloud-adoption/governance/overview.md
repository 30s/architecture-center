# Fusion: Developing and implementing a cloud governance strategy

The cloud creates new paradigms regarding the technologies that support the business. These new paradigms also cause shifts in how those technologies are adopted, managed, and governed. When entire data centers can be destroyed and recreated with one line of code executed from an unattended process, we have to rethink traditional approaches. This is equally true when it comes to governance.

For organizations with existing policies governing on-premises IT environments, cloud governance should complement those policies. However, the level of policy integration between on-premises and the cloud will vary depending on cloud governance maturity and digital estate in the cloud. As the cloud estate evolves over time, so will cloud governance processes and policies.

## Using this guide

The Fusion guide to Cloud Governance will aid in developing a robust cloud governance strategy in parallel to cloud implementation. The guidance walks the reader through the theory and implementation of such a strategy. At the end of this initial framework, the reader will be presented with a few different design templates to use as a starting point in governance implementation. The theory documentation proceeding those templates will explain how the reader can customize those templates to mitigate tangible business risks.

1) Incremental Cloud Governance: The theory that drives this model.
2) Corporate Policy: An approach to understanding tangible business risk and turning that into actionable corporate policy statements with measurable results.
3) Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance: A framework for decomposing risks and breaking it into actionable disciplines which include policy, process, and implementation best practices
4) Choosing an Actionable Design Templates: Comparison of the use cases and policies that drove the design guidance samples, so the reader can find the one that best fits their needs.
5) Modifying the chosen Design Template: How to use the theories outlined in steps 1 - 3 to mold the template to fit the readers specific needs.

Through this guidance, the reader can start small and evolve their governance needs in parallel with cloud adoption efforts.

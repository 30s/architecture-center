# Fusion: Developing and implementing a cloud governance strategy

The cloud creates new paradigms regarding the technologies that support the business. These new paradigms also cause shifts in how those technologies are adopted, managed, and governed. When entire data centers can be destroyed and recreated with one line of code executed from an unattended process, we have to rethink traditional approaches. This is equally true when it comes to governance.

For organizations with existing policies governing on-premises IT environments, cloud governance should complement those policies. However, the level of corporate policy integration between on-premises and the cloud will vary depending on cloud governance maturity and digital estate in the cloud. As the cloud estate evolves over time, so will cloud governance processes and policies.

The guidance in this section of Fusion is designed for two purposes:

* Provide design templates which encapsulate business risks, corporate policies for risk mitigation, and design guidance to implement technical solutions.
* Help readers create personalized governance solutions that can meet a variety of business needs, including the governance of multiple public clouds, through detailed guidance on the development of corporate policies, processes, and tooling.

This content has been created specifically for members of the Cloud Governance Team. However, it can also be applicable to Cloud Architects who needs to develop a strong foundation in cloud governance.

## Using this guide

For readers who wish to leverage this guide from beginning to end, this content will aid in developing a robust cloud governance strategy in parallel to cloud implementation. The guidance walks the reader through the theory and implementation of such a strategy.

For a crash course on the theory and quick access to Azure implementation, get started with the [Overview of Actionable Governance Journeys](./design-guides/overview.md). Through this guidance, the reader can start small and evolve their governance needs in parallel with cloud adoption efforts.

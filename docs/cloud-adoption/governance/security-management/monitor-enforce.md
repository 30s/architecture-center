# Fusion: Security management policy processes

This article discusses an approach to policy adherence processes that govern [security management](./overview.md). Effective governance of cloud security starts with recurring manually processes designed to detect vulnerabilities and impose policies to mitigate those security risks. However, you can automate these processes and supplement with tooling to reduce the overhead of governance and allow for faster response to deviation.

## Planning and reporting processes

The best security management tools in the cloud are only as good as the processes and policies that they support. The following is a set of manual processes for any security management discipline.

The following are examples of triggers:

## Next steps

Using the [Cloud Management template](./template.md), document the processes and triggers that align to the current cloud adoption plan.

For guidance on executing cloud management policies in alignment with adoption plans, see the article on [maturity alignment](maturity-adoption-alignment.md).

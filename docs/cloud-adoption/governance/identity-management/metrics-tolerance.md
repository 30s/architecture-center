# Fusion: Metrics, indicators, and risk tolerance 

This article is intended to help you quantify business risk tolerance as it relates to identity management. Defining metrics and indicators helps you create a business case for making an investment in the maturity of the Identity Management discipline.

## Metrics and identity information

Identity management focuses identifying, authenticating, and authorizing individuals, groups of users, or automated processes, and providing them appropriate access to resources in your cloud deployments. The following information is useful when adopting this discipline of cloud governance:

* Resource classification: What resources are part of your planned cloud deployment, what do they do, and what organization owns them? What are business impacts of these resources, and do they involve sensitive data?
* Account manifest: List of accounts, including users, groups, and system accounts. What percentage of these accounts are inactive or otherwise unused?
* Account Access: Details about the rights accounts have. What percentage of accounts have admin or other elevated rights?
* Activity data: Log and monitoring data for user activity. Who is accessing what resources? What percentage of access requests fail or appear to be suspicious?

## Next steps

Using the [Cloud Management template](./template.md), document metrics and tolerance indicators that align to the current cloud adoption plan.

Building on risks and tolerance, establish a [process for governing and communicating security policy adherence](processes.md).

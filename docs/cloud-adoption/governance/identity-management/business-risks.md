# Fusion: Motivations and business risks that drive identity governance

This article discusses the reasons that customers typically adopt an identity management discipline within a cloud governance strategy. It also provides a few examples of business risks which drive policy statements.

## Is identity management relevant?

Identity services provide the core access control mechanism of all IT environments, and the identity management discipline complements the[security management discipline](../security-management/overview.md) by securing user access to cloud-based resources. 

Traditional on-premises directories are designed to allow businesses to strictly control permissions and policies for users, groups, and roles within their internal networks and datacenters. This is usually intended to support single tenant implementations, with services applicable only within the on-premises environment. 

Cloud identity services are intended to expand an organization's authentication and access control capabilities across the internet. They support multi-tenancy and can be used to manage access policy across cloud applications and deployments. All public cloud platforms have some form of identity management services supporting management and deployment tasks and are capable of [varying levels of integration](../../infrastructure/identity/overview.md) with your existing on-premises identity solutions. All of these features can result in cloud identity policy being more complicated than your traditional on-premises solutions required. 

The importance of the identity management discipline to your cloud deployment will depend on the size of your team and the importance of combining your cloud-based identity solution with your existing on-premises directory. Initial test deployments may not require much in the way of user organization or management, but as your cloud estate matures, you will likely need to support more complicated organization support. 

## Business risk

The identity management discipline attempts to address the following business risks. During cloud adoption, monitor each of the following for relevance:

* Over-provisioned access: users and groups with control over resources beyond their area of responsibility can easily make changes that cause outages or security breaches.
* Credential security: User accounts lacking a strong authentication method can be potentially compromised, allowing malicious access to secure resources.
* Organization: Large teams can be difficult to manage if organizational policies are not applied to access control. This can  result in oversight or errors in securing resources.
* Authentication protocols: Cloud identity solutions generally do not natively support legacy authentication protocols such as Kerberos or NTLM, which can require extensive refactoring of applications migrating to the cloud.

## Next steps

Using the [Cloud Management Template](./template.md), document business risks that are likely to be introduced by the current cloud adoption plan.

Once an understanding of realistic business risks is established, the next step is to document the business's [tolerance for risk](./metrics-tolerance.md) and the indicators / key metrics to monitor that tolerance.

# Fusion: Choose a Governance Design Template

If you've been reading along with the table of contents, you should now have an understanding of the cloud agnostic theories behind Incremental Governance, Corporate Policy, and the Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance. This document will help you choose a design template that fits both current and future governance needs.

## Pre-cursor: Change is coming

Regardless of the design template chosen, the reader will likely need to modify the template before implementation. Business risks and the governance implemented to mitigate those risks is very personal. The cloud adoption being implemented, the businesses tolerance for risk, and the approach to mitigation could all shift the guidance provided.

Before implementation of any of the following, you may want to come back & read the article on [modifying a design template](./modify-a-design-template.md).

## Design Template Matrix

|Template  |Audience  |Adoption Indicators  |Investment Indicators  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Future Proof     |Medium size business or business units in a large enterprise         |Early stage         |Not ready to invest         |
|Production Workload     |Medium size business or business units in a large enterprise         |Production with protected data or mission critical apps         |Need to protect customers and business processes         |
|Enterprise MVP     |Enterprise         |Early stage         |Not ready to invest         |
|Enterprise @ Scale     |Enterprise         |Higher volume of deployments         |         |
|Enterprise Guard Rails     |Enterprise         |High volume, protected data, & mission critical apps         |Need to protect customers and business processes         |
|Multi-Cloud     |All of the above         |Multiple public cloud providers         |Need to understand governance across providers         |

# Fusion: Metrics, indicators, and risk tolerance

This article is intended to help you quantify business risk tolerance as it relates to configuration management. Defining metrics and indicators helps you create a business case for making an investment in the maturity of the Configuration Management discipline.

## Metrics

Configuration management focuses on deploying, updating, and maintaining cloud resources with the configurations required for proper systems operation. The following information is useful when adopting this discipline of cloud governance:

## Risk tolerance indicators

Risks related to configuration management are largely related to the number and complexity of cloud-based systems deployed for your enterprise.

    If all of your users and groups are managed using a single directory or cloud native identity provider using minimal integration with other services, your risk level will likely be small. However, as your business needs grow your identity management systems may need to support more complicated scenarios, such as multiple directories to support your internal organization or federation with external identity providers. As these systems become more complex, risk increases.

In the early stages of cloud adoption, work with your IT security team and business stakeholders to identify [business risks](business-risks.md) related to configuration, then determine an acceptable baseline for configuration risk tolerance. This section of the Fusion guidance provides examples, but the detailed risks and baselines for your company or deployments may be different.

Once you have a baseline, establish minimum benchmarks representing an unacceptable increase in your identified risks. These benchmarks act as triggers for when you need to take action to mitigate these risks. The following are a few examples of how configuration-related metrics, such as those discussed above, can justify an increased investment in the Configuration Management discipline.

## Next steps

Using the [Cloud Management template](./template.md), document metrics and tolerance indicators that align to the current cloud adoption plan.

Building on risks and tolerance, establish a [process for governing and communicating security policy adherence](processes.md).

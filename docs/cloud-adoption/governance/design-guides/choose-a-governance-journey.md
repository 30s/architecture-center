# Fusion: Choosing the best Governance Journey

To begin using a governance journey, choose one of the two options below. The options are based on synthesized customer experiences. The titles are derived from the size of the enterprise for ease of navigation. However, the reader's decision may be a bit more involved. The following tables outline the differences between the two options.

> [!NOTE]
> It is very likely that neither solution aligns perfectly. Choose the one that is closest as a starting point. Through the governance journeys, additional information will be provided to help customize decisions to fit specific criteria.

## Business Criteria

|Title  |[Small to Medium Enterprise](./small-to-medium-enterprise/overview.md)  |[Large Enterprise](./large-enterprise/overview.md)  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Business units impacted |Single business unit | Multiple business units |
|Geography (Country or geo-political region) | Customers or staff are largely in one geography | Customers or staff are supported by datacenters in multiple geographies |
|IT budget |Single IT budget | Budget allocated across business units |

## Current State (before adopting Cloud Governance)

|Title | [Small to Medium Enterprise](./small-to-medium-enterprise/overview.md) | [Large Enterprise](./large-enterprise/overview.md) |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Datacenter or 3rd party hosting providers | <5 datacenters | >5 datacenters |
| Network | No WAN, or 1-2 WAN providers | Complex &/or Global WAN |
|Identity | Single forest, single domain. No requirement for claims-based authentication or 3rd party MFA devices | Complex, multiple forests, multiple domains. Applications will require claims-based authentication &/or 3rd party MFA devices |

## Future State Evolutions (After evolving Cloud Governance)

|Title  |[Small to Medium Enterprise](./small-to-medium-enterprise/overview.md) | [Large Enterprise](./large-enterprise/overview.md) |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Security management &mdash; protected data | Showback model. Billing is centralized through IT. | Chargeback model. Billing could be distributed through IT procurement. |
|Resource management &mdash; mission critical apps | Company financial data & IP, limited customer data. No 3rd party compliance requirements. | Multiple collections of customer financial and PII data. May need to consider 3rd party compliance. |
|Cost management &mdash; cloud accounting | Outages are painful but not financially damaging. Existing IT Operations is relatively immature. | Outages have defined and monitored financial impacts. IT Operations is established and mature. |

## Next steps

The two governance journeys represent two extremes of the experiences of customers who invest in cloud governance. For most readers, the company they work for will have combinations of the two scenarios above. After reviewing the design guide, the Fusion Governance Model can be used to approach the governance conversation and modify the initial governance journeys to more closely meet their needs.

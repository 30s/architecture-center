# Fusion: Actionable Governance Journeys

The following governance journeys illustrate the use of the Incremental Governance Model and the application of the Fusion Cloud Governance Model. Together, these models establish an agile governance platform that can evolve to meet the needs of any cloud governance scenario. Before using either guide, review the brief background on both models to understand the basic theories in this guide.

For readers that are familiar with the model, jump ahead to the appropriate cloud design guide:
* [Large Enterprise Governance Journey](./large-enterprise/overview.md)
* [Small to Medium Enterprise Governance Journey](./small-to-medium-enterprise/overview.md)

## Understanding the journey

Adoption of the cloud is journey, not a destination. Along the way, there are clear milestones and tangible business values. However, the final state of cloud adoption is seldom understood when a company embarks on the journey. A key part of the cloud adoption journey, is cloud governance. Cloud governance creates the guardrails that keep the company on a safe path, avoiding perils along the journey.

This design guide establishes a narrative that follows a synthesized Small to Medium Enterprise through the governance portion of their journey. The objective of this narrative is to develop a series of template that the reader can consume and personalize to provide guardrails during their own journey.

### Fusion Governance Model: Establishing an end state

A journey with no target destination, is really just glorified wandering. It's important to establish a rough vision of the end state, before taking the first step. The infographic below sets a frame of reference for the end state. It is not a starting point, but a picture of one potential destination.

The Fusion governance model outlines areas of focus throughout the journey. Each will protect the company from a different type of peril, as the company adopts more cloud services. This design guide will use this frame of reference frequently to describe necessary actions on the part of the Cloud Governance Team. Along the way, each of these tenants of the Fusion Governance Model will be expanded on to guide actions. At the highest level they are described as follows:

**Corporate Policy:** The policies which drive all cloud governance. In this model, the aspects of corporate policy that this design guide will focus on are Business Risks (building an understanding of risk), Policy & Compliance (Converting risks into policy statements which support any require compliance needs), and Processes (Which ensure adherence to the policy statements).

**Governance Disciplines:** Supporting corporate policy are the five disciplines of Cloud Governance: Cost Management, Security Management, Resource Management, Identity Management, and Configuration Management. Each of these vital disciplines protect the company from a different potential pitfall. 
Essentially, the Corporate Policies serve as the early warning system to detect potential perils. The Disciplines then move ahead of the business to mitigate risks (or create guard rails).

### Incremental Governance Model: MVP and Evolution

The Fusion Governance Model includes additional documentation on Incremental Governance. However, a high-level understanding is required to use this design guide.

Assuming cloud adoption is a journey and governance will evolve along the journey, a different model of governance is required. Companies can no longer wait for a small team to build guardrails and roadmaps on every highway in the country, before taking the first step. Business results are expected far faster and more fluidly than that.

To meet the needs of the business, the IT team needs to be agile and equally fast moving. The incremental governance model empowers these traits. In incremental governance a smaller set of precautions is established creating a foundation for adoption, also known as an MVP or Minimally Viable Product. This MVP provides the governance team with a means for quickly injecting governance into any implementation. 

![Example of Incremental Governance evolutions](../../_images/governance/incremental-governance-example.png)

In the example captured in the infographic above, a company implements a Governance MVP to serve as a foundation for all cloud adoption. Cloud adoption then progresses at its own pace. During the cloud adoption journey, deployment plans introduce risks. When those risks are uncovered by the cloud governance team, each of the impacted Disciplines of Cloud Governance is advanced to mitigate the risk. In this example, the cloud adoption plan introduces risks related to protected data, requiring implementations of security management and configuration management. The business then experiences risks related to mission critical workloads, requiring an evolution of the resource management discipline and configuration management changes. Finally, the business experiences risks related to cloud costs, triggering evolutions in cost management. Because of the foundation established by the Governance MVP, these changes can be implemented and enforced with less difficulty. Each cloud adoption journey is unique. This may not align to the order in which the reader's cloud governance evolves, but this example is representative of the journey as a whole.

The ability to rapidly respond to changing risks, repositions the governance focus. This approach allows the Cloud Governance Team to join the Cloud Strategy Team as scouts, moving ahead of the adoption teams, plotting routes, and quickly deploying guardrails to protect against perils on the specific route chosen. This model to governance evolves the governance strategy one step ahead of the adoption team.

### Tying these models together

This actionable governance journey's will demonstrate the implementation of an MVP foundation for governance. From there, each journey will show how governance can run ahead of adoption as a partner and accelerator for adoption efforts. The Fusion Governance Model will be used to guide the execution of governance during the foundation and subsequent evolutions.

Note: Governance is not a replacement for key functions, like security, networking, identity, finance, devops or operations. Along the way, there will be dependencies and interactions with teammates in each function. Often times, members of those functions may even serve as members of the Cloud Governance Team to accelerate decisions and actions.

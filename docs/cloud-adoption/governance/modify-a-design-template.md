# Fusion: Modify a Governance Design Template

## Why modify a template

## Modify Corporate Policy

Rethink risk, metrics, policy statements, and processes

## Evolve the discipline

### Not sure what to modify

The five disciplines can help identify changes that might be useful. THey can also help surface risks you may not be thinking about.

### Expand Discipline toolchain implementation

Each discipline has options for tooling that we are additive in many cases, or may shift over time.

### Deeper implementation of each discipline

Each discipline may eventually contain additional options and best practices to evolve the discipline. Do we include these? Do we start a page for best practices in each and include a bunch of links that grow over time?

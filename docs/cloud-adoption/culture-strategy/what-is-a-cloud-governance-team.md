# Fusion: What is a cloud governance team?

Any kind of change generates new risks. The cloud governance team works with the business team and [cloud strategy team](what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md) to evaluate risks vs risk tolerance. This team identifies risks that can not be tolerated by the business and converts those into governing corporate policies. Those policies are then executed through the disciplines of cloud governance. 

## Team structure

The cloud governance team covers: 
- The corporate policies (risk, policies, and enforcement).  
- The governance disciplines that make corporate policies actionable. 

The cloud governance team focuses on Corporate Policies as they relate to governance of the cloud within an enterprise. However, the team structure consists of members from various teams with different roles. Some of those team members are also likely to be the employees who implement the policies in the form of technical disciplines.

- Leaders from middle management and direct contributors in key roles, who have been appointed to represent the business. 

- The cloud governance team should be an extension of the [cloud strategy team](what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md). Just as the CIO and business leaders are expected to participate in cloud strategy team, their direct reports are expected to participate in cloud governance team. 

- Business employees that are members of the business unit who work closely with the leadership of the line of business. Hence, they are are empowered to make decisions regarding corporate and technical risk. 
- Information Technology (IT) and Information Security (IS) employees who understand the technical aspects of the cloud transformation. These members bring together the business, IT, and IS in a regular cadence. Being focused on transformation risk is the foundation of an incremental governance model.

The cloud governance team identifies risks related to current and future releases. The team has sufficient capabilities to evaluate the risk, understand the potential impacts, and make decisions regarding risk tolerance. In doing so, the team can respond quickly to the changing needs of the [cloud adoption team](what-is-a-cloud-adoption-team.md). 

The team also proposes the decision to the [cloud strategy team](what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md) for validation and final approval. Specifically, decisions that involve sensitive data or access to business critical systems.

## Key responsibilities

The primary duty of a cloud governance team is to balance competing forces of transformation and risk mitigation. Additionally, The team must also to ensure that the [cloud adoption team](what-is-a-cloud-adoption-team.md) is aware of data & asset classification and  architecture guidelines governing adoption approaches. 

These tasks are usually executed by the cloud governance team on a monthly basis:

**Early planning tasks:**

* Understand [business risks](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md) introduced by the plan
* Represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md)
* Aid in the creation of a [Governance MVP](../governance/policy-compliance/overview.md)

**On-going Monthly Tasks:**

* Understand [business risks](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md) introduced during each release
* Represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md)
* Aid in the evolution of [Policy and Compliance requirements](../governance/policy-compliance/overview.md)

## Meeting cadence

The tasks listed in preceding section can be time consuming in the early planning phases. Here are some recommendations for the cloud governance team members: 
- Spend an hour each week to meet with team. After the migration plan starts to solidify (usually within 4-6 weeks), the time requirements can be reduced. 
- Spend 1-2 hours each month throughout the transformation journey.

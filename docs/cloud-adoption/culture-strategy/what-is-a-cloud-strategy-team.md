# Fusion: What is a Cloud Strategy Team?

Successful cloud transformation must engage business leaders from across the organization. To unite various leaders, the recommendation is that the executive leadership create a cloud strategy team.

The goal of the cloud strategy team is to produce tangible business results that are enabled by cloud technologies. The team ensures that the cloud transformation progresses in alignment with business outcomes. 

The cloud strategy team members can see across business, culture, and technical change to shape transformation and influence the culture.

## Team structure

This team consists of business leaders from:

 - Finance
 - Line of business
 - HR 
 - Operations
 - Enterprise architecture 
 - IT infrastructure 
 - Application groups 
 
The members can help guide critical prioritization and discover efforts during the transformation.

Consider digital transformation. It can trigger changes in business processes, the execution of operations, customer interactions, or even product development. If it is only confined to the IT team, the transormation cannot be fully successful. To drive true business change, business leaders must participate in the process. cloud strategy team provides a means for involving key participants in a structured way.

The organization's CEO and CIO often assign the team. Assignments are generally based on empowering this team to drive change that cuts across various different organizations within the enterprise. The cloud strategy team members should be assigned based on the [Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/overview.md) that best aligns with the current corporate objectives & priorities. 

## Key responsibilities

The primary duty of the cloud strategy team is to validate alignment between business priorities and the [Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/overview.md). However, the primary duty is broader. 

These tasks are usually executed by the cloud strategy team on a monthly basis: 

**Early planning tasks**

* Review and provide feedback on [Business Outcomes](../business-strategy/business-outcomes/overview.md) and [Financial Models](../business-strategy/financial-models.md)
* Aid in establishing clear [motivations for cloud adoption](../business-strategy/motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud.md) that align with corporate objectives
* Define relevant [learning metrics](../business-strategy/learning-metrics.md) that clearly communicate progress towards business outcomes
* Understand [business risks](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md) introduced by the plan, represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md)
* Review and approve the [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/overview.md)

**On-going monthly tasks**

* Support the [cloud governance team](what-is-a-cloud-governance-team.md) during risk/tolerance conversations
* Review release plans to understand timelines and business impact of technical change
* Define Business Change Plans associated with planned releases
* Ensure business teams are ready to execute Business Testing and Business Change Plan

## Meeting cadence

The tasks listed in preceding section can be time consuming in the early planning phases. Here are some recommendations for the cloud strategy team members: 
- Spend an hour each week to meet with team. After the migration plan starts to solidify (usually within 4-6 weeks), the time requirements can be reduced. 
- Spend 1-2 hours each month throughout the transformation journey. Additionally, time is likely to be required from delegated members of the executive's team on an as-needed-basis.

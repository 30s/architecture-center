# Fusion: What is a cloud adoption team?

Cloud transformations can impact a number of technologies. The cloud adoption team drives the technical change within a  transformation. This team is responsible for migrating assets to the cloud, evolving applications and experiences, and/or developing new data-driven products. 

## Team structure

This team comprised of technical skills across IT and business analysis. It is not uncommon for the cloud adoption team to include both full-time employees and third-party consultants.

Depending on the desired business outcomes, the skills needed on this team can include:

- Infrastructure adminstrators
- Devops specialists
- Application developers
- Data scientists

Before forming a cloud adoption team, the organization must align to a common theme or [Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/overview.md). Each journey aligns with a specific skill set and roles that are best suited for the success of the transformation.

This team usually is a flat structure with direct interactions between the [cloud strategy team](what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md) and [cloud governance team](what-is-a-cloud-governance-team.md) for fluid communication and the ability to unblock projects. In the early releases, direct interaction is necessary to discuss technical and cultural blockers that require support from both teams. This team should be self-organizing from a technical execution perspective. Inclusion of project management with deep experience in agile, scrum, or other iterative models is also highly recommended.

In some organizations, the adoption effort is larger than what the team can handle. In those cases, maintaining a flat structure is difficult and does not serve the purpose of the team. The cloud adoption team can provide hands-on execution and help scale various skills to other teams. As skills spread throughout the technical side of the enterprise, a higher number of engineers can contribute to the transformation and adoption effort. This variation tends to ebb snd flow across various releases, so it is still suggested that the cloud adoption team remain as a single unit, but allow the tasks to change with the migration plan.

## Key responsibilities

The primary duty of a cloud adoption team is to ensure the technical completion of the adoption plan in alignment with corporate policies and architecture guidelines. This team also focuses on expanding the skill set of other engineers. At times this team may also serve as an interface or guide to technical operations teams, help mold existing practices and tools to support the cloud. 

**Early planning tasks:**

* Execute the [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/overview.md)
* Develop a [prioritized migration backlog](../migration/plan/migration-backlog.md)
* Begin execution of the [first workload](../migration/plan/first-workload.md)

**On-going monthly tasks:**

* Oversee [change management processes](../migration/plan/iterative-change-management.md)
* Manage the [on-going backlog](../migration/plan/migration-backlog.md)
* Maintain/build [core infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview.md)
* Execute the [adoption or migration process](../migration/execute/overview.md)

## Team cadence

It is recommended that this team is dedicated to the effort full time. Because the technical work associated with some cloud transformation can become repetitive, rotate the team members every 3-6 months to avoid employee satisfaction issues and maintain relevant skills.
